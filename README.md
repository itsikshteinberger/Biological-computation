# Biological-computation

Four small mini-projects on different topics of biological computation.

## Cellular autmata
A cellular automata that simulates climate changes under the effects of the existence of cities, forests and glaciers, the calculation also takes into account other variables such as winds and precipitation within one large set of transition conditions.

## Genetic algorithm
A genetic algorithm for finding a cellular automata of the "Methushlah" type - an automata that converges only after a long time and produces a relatively high number of living cells during its run.

## Neural Network
Implementation of the famous algorithm of neural networks from scratch on the famous data set of iris flowers.

## Molecular calculation
The famous solution of the 3-set problem using molecular calculation - a simulation of a biological laboratory in which the 3-set problem is solved using biological tools without a computer.
